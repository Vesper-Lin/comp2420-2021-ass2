    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to submit the following items:\n",
    "- The notebook `Assignment-2.ipynb` \n",
    "- A completed `statement-of-originality.md`, found in the root of the forked gitlab repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submissions are performed by pushing to your forked GitLab assignment repository. For a refresher on forking and cloning repositories, please refer to `Lab 1`. Issues with your Git repo (with the exception of a CECS/ANU wide Gitlab failure) will not be considered as grounds for an extension. Any variation of this will result in a `zero mark`.\n",

    "### Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is strongly advised to read the whole assignment before attempting it and have at least a cursory glance at the dataset in order to gauge the requirements and understand what you need to do as a bigger picture.\n",
    "* Backup your assignment to your Gitlab repo often. \n",
    "* Extra reading and research will be required. Make sure you include all references in your Statement of Originality. If this does not occur, at best marks will be deduced. Otherwise, academic misconduct processes will be followed.\n",
    "* For answers requiring free form written text, use the designated cells denoted by `YOUR WRITTEN ANSWER HERE` -- double click on the cell to write inside them.\n",
    "* For all coding questions please write your code after the comment `YOUR CODE HERE`.\n",
    "* In the process of testing your code, you can insert more cells or use print statements for debugging, but when submitting your file remember to remove these cells and calls respectively. You are welcome to add additional cells to the final submission, provided they add value to the overall piece.\n",
    "* Your code answers will be marked on **correctness** and **readability** of your code, if your marker can't understand your code your marks may be deducted. \n",
    "* Your written answers will be marked on the **correctness**, **depth** and **clarity** of your written answers. If your marker cannot understand your answer, marks may be deducted\n",
    "* Before submitting, restart the kernel in Jupiter Lab and re-run all cells before submitting your code. This will ensure the namespace has not kept any old variables, as these won't come across in submission and your code will not run. Without this, you could lose a significant number of marks.\n",

    "2. The issue derives from the instruction \"The transcoding score can be obtained by taking the average of umem and utime and then normalizing it.\" I observe that umem and utime are significantly different in numbers: umem is too large but utime is relatively small. Consequently, if I calculate the average of umem and utime, the result of transcoding score will be heavily skewed towards umem. After normalization, most of the classfication labels become 'Cheap'. Such an unbalance in distribution results in the high accuracy for predicting label 'Cheap', but 0 accuracy for predicting label 'Moderate'.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. I import and pre-process the sdss dataset as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I use Pearson correlation to compute the correlation scores between the category and other variables, then I print the correlation score statistics and visualize them. Based on the result, I extract features that have a relatively high correlation score with category as predictors, and category as response, to build the DecisionTree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I split the dataset into training set (80%) and testing set (20%), then divide the training and testing set for the predictor and the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I build GridSearchCV model, visualize the mean scores for hyper-parameters: max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf of the DecisionTree, and print the optimal values for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I use these optimal parameters to build the DecisionTree model and fit the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To evaluate the model's performance, I calculate the Training Score and the Testing Score, and compare the two scores to detect overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. I get the response predicting set for the predictor testing set, and compare it with the response testing set to get the normalized confusion matrix which statistically indicates the prediction result. I also visualize the confusion matrix for different classfications.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. I generate a report to show some other classification scoring metrics, including: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. I plot a figure of the decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~ How does my decision tree work:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot above, I observe that my decision tree makes splits only according to the 'redshift' feature. Starting from the split of the root node, the model keeps measuring the subsets' impurity by the gini score and perform the best split according to the one that produces the purest subsets (Ceballos, 2019). The max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf are the parameters that constrain the expand of the notes, so that the model avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Validity of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Training Score and the Testing Score of the model are high as 0.99, which is nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Training Score does not exceed the Testing Score, hence my decision tree model avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The normalized confusion matrix shows that our prediction of class 'STAR', 'GALAXY', 'QSO' have accruacy of 100%, 99%, 92%. That's a success!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The classification report shows that the model's overall accuracy score is 0.99, and the macro average metrics for precision score, recall score, F1 score are 0.98, 0.97, 0.98. Three classes' classfication scoring metrics all exceed 0.90. Hence, my decision tree model satisfies the validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~Strengths of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model uses correlation score to determine features used as predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model uses GridSearchCV to determine optimal hyper-parameters for the DecisionTree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The model's performance can be validated by taining/testing scores and various statistical classification metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~Pitifalls of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During the selection of predictors, I find that none of the other features have a correlation score higher than 0.3 with the 'category' feature. This may cause potential overfitting for my decision tree, because they are not so relevant with the response feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As observed from the decision tree plot, the splitting questions in the tree are all based on the 'redshift' feature, which is not normal for a typical decision tree. I think it is because I do not optimize 'max_features' during hyper-parameter optimization, thus this parameter is constrained by other parameters like 'max_depth'."

It is because public does not equally consent to this act. There must be guidelines.

Before releasing data, agencies should carefully consider and address any privacy concerns.*\"\n",

The contract has to be signed by both Lux and Kay, and then finally by Ray Technologies. We assume that the contract is transmitted electronically over public channels, so integrity and confidentiality have to be assured. Both Lux and Kay need to be assured that they are both signing the same contract and need to each have a copy of the contract signed by all three parties involved.
